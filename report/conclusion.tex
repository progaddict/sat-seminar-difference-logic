\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Difference logic is widely used to describe timing-related problems.
Since difference logic is a special case of linear arithmetic logic,
it is possible to employ simplex to decide satisfiability
of difference logic constraints.
However, simplex has exponential complexity whereas the graph-based
algorithm, described in this report, has polynomial complexity.

The algorithm works on a constraint graph which represents
a conjunction of difference logic constraints.
The idea of the algorithm is based on the fact that
negative or zero length cycles in the constraint graph
correspond to a sequence of difference logic inequalities which,
if summed together, will produce a conflicting
inequality $ 0 < 0 $ or $ 0 \prec c $ where
$ c $ is a negative constant and $ \prec \; \in \{ <, \le \} $.
The inequalities, which correspond to the cycle,
form the explanation for the SAT solver.

The ingenious thing about the algorithm is that it does not
enumerate all the cycles in a constraint graph but rather
detects any cycle in a dynamic admissible graph and
therefore achieves Bellman-Ford algorithm's complexity
$ O(|E| \cdot |V|) $.
Enumerating all cycles is prohibitively expensive in terms
of computational complexity because there can be exponentially
many of them in a graph.
