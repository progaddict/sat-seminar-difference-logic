    This report describes difference logic, which is a special case
    of linear arithmetic logic, and a graph-based
    algorithm for deciding satisfiability (SAT) of
    a conjunction of difference logic (DL) flormulas.
    There is of course a simplex-based algorithm, which can also
    do that.
    However, it has exponential complexity whereas
    the graph-based algorithm, described here,
    has polynomial complexity.

    Difference logic constraints appear in many timing related problems
    such as \eg scheduling problems,
    detecting race conditions in digital circuits \etc
    Therefore it is very important to have an efficient algorithm
    to decide whether they are satisfiable or not.
