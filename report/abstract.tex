    This report describes the difference logic (DL) and a graph-based
    approach for solving satisfiability (SAT) problem of DL formulas.
    There is of course a simplex-based algorithm which solves
    SAT problem of any linear arithmetic (LA) constraints.
    However, it is not efficient compared to the algorithm described in
    the report because simplex does not utilize the simple structure of
    DL constraints.

    Efficiently solving SAT problem of DL constraints is very
    important because a lot of timing related problems can be described
    by this logic \eg scheduling problems, detecting race conditions
    in digital circuits \etc

    The report is organized as follows.
    Chapter~\ref{sec:introduction} introduces difference logic and
    SAT checking.
    Chapter~\ref{sec:preliminaries} gives theoretical background.
    Chapter~\ref{sec:topic} describes a graph-based approach to solving
    SAT problem of DL.
    Chapter~\ref{sec:conclusion} draws a conclusion.
