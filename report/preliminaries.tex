\subsection{Solving SAT Problem of Propositional Logic}
Most of the SAT solvers employ a variation of the
Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL)
algorithm~\cite{davis1960computing, davis1962machine}
for deciding satisfiability of propositional logic.
Algorithm~\ref{alg:basic-sat} is an example of
such a basic satisfiability checking algorithm.

\begin{Algorithm}
    \caption{A basic satisfiability checking algorithm for deciding
        satisfiability problem of propositional logic.}
    \label{alg:basic-sat}
    \begin{algorithm}{Check}{}
        \begin{IF}{! \: \CALL{Propagate}()}
            \RETURN UNSAT
        \end{IF} \\
        \begin{WHILE}{True}
            \begin{IF}{! \: \CALL{Theory}()}
                \begin{IF}{! \: \CALL{Resolve}()}
                    \RETURN UNSAT
                \end{IF}
                \ELSE
                \begin{IF}{! \: \CALL{Decide}()}
                    \RETURN SAT
                \end{IF}
            \end{IF} \\
            \begin{WHILE}{! \: \CALL{Propagate}()}
                \begin{IF}{! \: \CALL{Resolve}()}
                    \RETURN UNSAT
                \end{IF}
            \end{WHILE}
        \end{WHILE}
    \end{algorithm}
\end{Algorithm}

Algorithm~\ref{alg:basic-sat} is quite generic.
It is more of a template.
One needs to plug into this template his own implementations of the
following functions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[$ \algCALL{Propagate} $] Propagates
    current variable assignments
    and returns $ True $ iff
    the propagation has not run into a conflict.
    \item[$ \algCALL{Decide} $] Tries to extend
    current variable assignments
    by selecting a next variable
    and setting it to a value
    according to some heuristic
    and returns $ False $ iff
    all variables have been already set
    (nothing to assign).
    \item[$ \algCALL{Resolve} $] Tries to resolve a conflict
    and returns $ True $ iff it has been successfully resolved.
    \item[$ \algCALL{Theory} $] Checks current variable
    assignments and returns $ True $ iff it is consistent
    with the theory.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\cite{cotton2004some} mentions the following main approaches for
solving satisfiability problem of difference logic:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Preprocessing approach.
    This approach suggests transforming a difference logic
    formula into an equivalent propositional logic formula
    by encoding all intrinsic
    dependencies between difference logic constraints
    in propositional logic.
    An example of such a dependency is transitivity:
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:transitivity-example}
        (x-y<a) \land (y-z<b) \rightarrow (x-z<a+b)
    \end{equation}
    After the transformation a SAT solver can be used
    to check if the resulting
    equivalent propositional formula
    is satisfiable.
    If it is satisfiable then the solution for
    the original formula can be constructed
    by the reverse transformation.
    \item Lazy approach
    (Figure~\ref{fig:lazy-and-incremental-approaches} left).
    This approach suggests substituting
    each difference logic constraint
    $ x-y \prec c $ with
    a Boolean variable $ p_{xyc} \in \mathbb{B} $
    thus yielding a propositional logic formula~$ \phi' $.
    $ \phi' $ represents the "skeleton",
    the Boolean abstraction over
    the original formula $ \phi $.
    Then a SAT solver is used in tandem with
    a difference logic constraints checker (the theory solver)
    to solve the satisfiability problem.
    In this approach the SAT solver always computes
    a complete solution (variable assignments for all
    variables)
    which is then passed to the theory solver.
    \item Incremental approach
    (Figure~\ref{fig:lazy-and-incremental-approaches} right).
    In~\cite{cotton2004some} this approach is used.
    It is very similar to the lazy one.
    However, instead of computing a complete solution,
    the SAT solver invokes the difference logic
    constraints checker
    each time it updates its variable assignments
    and passes the constrains checker a partial solution.
    The constraints checker
    should be able to maintain some internal
    state of the currently received
    difference logic constraints and update it
    incrementally (\ie add new constraints, delete existing ones).
    Hence the name of the approach.
\end{itemize}
