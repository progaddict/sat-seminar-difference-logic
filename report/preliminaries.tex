\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:preliminaries}



\subsection{Constraint Graph (CG)}
Give definition of Constraint Graph and an example.
Tell also about Difference Bound Matrix (DBM).
Allude to the fact that SAT problem can be described in terms
of a testing a CG on a negative cycle.



\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}
Describe Bellman-Ford algorithm and how is it applied to the
DL SAT problem:
"We detect cycles using a depth-first variant of the Bellman-Ford-Moore algorithm [GR93] which has much better average case complexity in practice"~\cite{cotton2004some}
